Inspired by Satish's [article](https://medium.com/@IndianGuru/using-go-with-microsofts-face-api-64b953a6c42d) on how to use Go with Microsoft's Cognitive Services, I created this sample application with Go to detect faces and emotions. 

In order to run the application please add your own subscription key `req.Header.Set("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", "Your key goes here")`. You can find this on the [Microsoft Cognitive Services website](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/).
